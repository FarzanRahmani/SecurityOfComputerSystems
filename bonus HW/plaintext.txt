SHEIKH SANAAN, AN OLD MAN, IS HIGHLY DEVOUT AND THE LEADER OF HIS PEOPLE. HE HAS LIVED IN KAABA FOR ABOUT FIFTY YEARS, ACCEPTING DISCIPLES AND PRAYING AND FASTING CONTINUOUSLY. HE HAS PERFORMED THE HAZZ FIFTY TIMES AND DISCOVERED MANY SPIRITUAL SECRETS. ONE DAY, HE HAS A DREAM THAT HE IS SETTLED IN RUM AND BOWING TO AN IDOL. THIS DREAM REPEATS OVER SEVERAL CONSECUTIVE NIGHTS. HE TRAVELS TO RUM WITH HIS DISCIPLES, WHERE HE MEETS A CHRISTIAN WOMAN AND FALLS IN LOVE WITH HER, SPENDING OVER A MONTH BEGGING FOR HER ACCEPTANCE. THE WOMAN COMES UP WITH FOUR CONDITIONS FOR THE SHEIKH: BOW TO THE IDOL, BURN THE JURAN, START DRINKING WINE AND ABANDON THE FAITH. IN ADDITION TO FULFILLING THESE CONDITIONS, SANAAN SHEPHERDS HER PIGS FOR A YEAR TO PAY THE MAHR. HIS DISCIPLES ARE DISAPPOINTED AND RETURN TO THEIR HOMELAND. A DISCIPLE WHO WAS NOT WITH HIM ON THE FIRST TRIP TRAVELS TO RUM, HOPING TO RESTORE SANAAN, AND SPENDS 40 DAYS PRAYING FOR HIM. FINALLY, THE DISCIPLE SEES THE PROPHET OF ISLAM IN A DREAM AND RECEIVES THE GOOD NEWS OF SANAANS RETURN. SANAAN IS FINALLY FREED FROM THE BONDAGE OF LOVE. THE WOMAN ALSO HAS A DREAM; SHE SEES THE SUN FALL BESIDE HER AND IT TELLS HER TO GO WITH THE SHEIKH. SHE TRAVELS TO HIS HOMELAND WITH HIM AND BECOMES A MUSLIM.
